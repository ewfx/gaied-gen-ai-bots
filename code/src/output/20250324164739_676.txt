Hello,





I hope you're doing well.





I am writing to you regarding the inquiry from our customer, Mr. Peterson (Account Number: 7894561230), concerning some transactions from last month, specifically around September 15th. He noticed that an amount was deducted for vendor 'Global Solutions Corp' (Transaction ID: GX1234567890) from one of his accounts that should have been debited from another account instead.





Could you please assist with gathering the necessary details and documentation to forward to the back office? Any information you can pull related to the specific transaction and vendor would be extremely helpful.





Thank you for your help.





Best regards,


Robert Dawson


Front Office Representative
