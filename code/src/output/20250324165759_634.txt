My business, Thompson Industries, is experiencing a period of growth, and I foresee a need for greater financial flexibility in the coming months. Last quarter, we recorded a significant increase in transaction volume, with numerous payments processed through vendor AlphaTech Solutions (Transaction IDs: AT-20231026-1, AT-20231026-2, AT-20231026-3) totaling $75,000. This growth is projected to continue, with anticipated contracts from BetaCorp and Gamma Dynamics in November. Iâ€™m expecting increased costs over the next three months. Would this be something you are able to assist with?Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.Sincerely,John ThompsonThompson IndustriesAttached Documents:report_LN-352394.pdfreport_LN-362913.pdf
