Hi Anya,

I just finished speaking with Mr. Davies. He confirmed the address is his current one. Also, I managed to download the latest statement from Global Trade Logistics - it's attached below. I also included copies of his driver license for verification purposes.

Please let me know if that will suffice, or if you need any additional documents from him.

Thanks,

Brian

Hi Brian,

Can you please assist with this? Mr. Davies is requesting an increase to his line of credit. See his email below. We need to gather some information to verify his identity and current financial standing. Specifically, please get his current address and most recent statement from Global Trade Logistics.

Let me know when you have that and I'll forward everything to the processing team.

Thanks!

Anya

Dear Anya,

Hope you're doing well.

I am writing to request an increase in our line of credit. As you know, Davies & Sons Importers has been a loyal customer of First United Bank for many years. Our business has been growing rapidly. We've landed a major new contract with Overseas Distributors Ltd. for shipments starting in Q1 of next year, and this will require a significant increase in our working capital.

Could you please let me know what steps are required to process this request?

Thanks for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

John Davies
