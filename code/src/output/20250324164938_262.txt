*   Anticipated Operating Expenses (Associated with OmniCorp Contract): $350,000.00

**Capital Requirements:**
To adequately fulfill the OmniCorp contract, Davidson Enterprises requires an additional $200,000.00 in working capital. This capital will be used to finance increased inventory, personnel, and operational expenses. We are seeking an adjustment to our existing facility to accommodate this need.

The increased profitability will ensure the company's ability to meet its financial obligations to Bank Alpha.
