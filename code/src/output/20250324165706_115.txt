I'm writing to inquire about some unusual activity on my business account, ending in 7890. I've noticed a few transactions that don't quite align with our typical operational expenses. Specifically, there are several payments to vendors I don't recognize, and the amounts seem higher than usual.For instance, a payment of $12,500.00 was made to "Apex Solutions" on October 10, 2023, transaction ID AXS20231010. I've never engaged with this vendor before. Similarly, a payment of $8,750.00 to "Data Dynamics Inc." on October 17, 2023, transaction ID DDI20231017, seems unusually high compared to our historical payments to them. Attached is a summary outlining all the unusual transactions. Please see attached report 1: "Harold Finch Initial Inquiry" for more details.Could you please investigate these transactions and provide me with more information about their origin and purpose? I'm also interested in understanding the security measures in place to prevent such occurrences in the future.Thank you for your time and assistance.Sincerely,Harold FinchCEO, FinchCorpAttached Documents:report_LN-803153.pdfreport_LN-371590.docx
