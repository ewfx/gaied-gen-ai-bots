Dear Janice,Hope you're having a good week. Following up on my call from yesterday regarding account 1234567890. I'm still a little unclear about a specific debit appearing on my recent statement. The transaction, dated October 15th, shows a deduction of $750 identified as "Service Fee." While I understand fees are sometimes necessary, I'd like to request a review of this particular charge, as it seems unusually high compared to our typical service agreements.I've attached the relevant invoice from AlphaCorp (dated October 2023-10-01) for your reference. Could you please look into this and let me know what options are available? Appreciate your help!Sincerely,Gregory Abernathy
