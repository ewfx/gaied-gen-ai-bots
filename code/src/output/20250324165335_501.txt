Dear Ms. Schultz,
Following our conversation last week, I’m writing to formally inquire about the possibility of re-evaluating the terms of our existing financing agreement (Account 7894561230). As we discussed, market conditions have shifted somewhat since we initially secured the arrangement back in January 2023. We are currently scheduled to make a payment of $12,500.00 on March 20, 2024. 
I've attached some updated figures to give you a clearer picture of our current standing and future projections. I am hoping this can allow us to possibly reduce our upcoming payments for the next quarter. Please let me know what further information you might require. 
Thank you for your time and assistance.
Sincerely,Gerald HendersonHenderson, Inc.
