As discussed, I’m looking to adjust my portfolio to better align with current market conditions and our company's updated investment strategy. I'd like to shift a bit more towards fixed income and away from some of the higher growth, more volatile assets that are currently over-weighted in the portfolio.Let me know if you need anything else from my end.Best,Richard DaviesDavies Investments

Davies Investmefts Portfolio Review - Account: 12345-67890

Date: October 26, 2023
Prepared for: Richard Davies

Executive Summary:
This document outlines the current asset allocation of Mr.
Davies' portfolio and highlights recommended adjustments to
align with his stated investment objectives and Davies
Investments’ updated guidelines. The current portfolio
demonstrates an overweighting in growth-oriented equity
assets relative to the benchmark and stated risk tolerance

Current Asset Allocation
* Equities: 65%

* Domestic Equities: 40%

* Intemational Equities: 25%
* Fixed Income: 25%

* Corporate Bonds: 15%

* Government Bonds: 10%
* Cash: 10%

Proposed Asset Allocation
* Equities: 55%

* Domestic Equities: 30%

* Intemational Equities: 25%
* Fixed Income: 35%

* Corporate Bonds: 20%

* Government Bonds: 15%
* Cash: 10%

Rationale
The proposed changes aim to reduce overall portfolio
volatility and enhance downside protection by increasing the
allocation to fixed income. This adjustment reflects a more
conservative approach, suitable given the current economic
outlook and Mr. Davies' moderate risk tolerance. Specific
trades will involve selling a portion of existing equity
holdings and reinvesting the proceeds into high-quality
corporate and government bonds. A rebalancing to the stated
allocations will occur across the portfolio by the end of

the month. Tax implications and costs have been taken into
consideration with an appropriate asset allocation.
