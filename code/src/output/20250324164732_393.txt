As we discussed, Sterling Co. has experienced some shifts in revenue allocation, and I'm hoping to explore options for adjusting the repayment schedule to better align with our current cash flow projections. The original loan was for $500,000, taken out on January 15, 2023, and a portion of the loan was used to purchase equipment from VendTech Solutions (Transaction ID: VT-20230115-001).Could you please advise on the necessary documentation required? I’m also attaching our latest financial statements for your review. We're aiming for a more balanced distribution of the principal payments over the remaining term of the loan. I've attached my financial statements to this email.Thank you for your time and assistance.Sincerely,Jasper SterlingCEO, Sterling Co.Attached Documents:report_LN-820414.png

Loan Account: 9§76-5432-1011

Borrower: Sterling Co
Original Loan Amount: $500,000.00
Origination Date: January 15, 2023
Vendor: VendTech Solutions
Transaction ID: VT-20230115-001

Reallocation Proposal Summary:

The borrower is requesting an adjustment to the principal
repayment schedule to better reflect current revenue
streams. The current schedule is heavily front-loaded,
placing a significant burden on Sterling Co.'s short-term
cash flow. The proposed adjustment aims to redistribute
principal payments more evenly across the remaining loan
term

Existing Principal Balance: $375,000.00
Remaining Term: 36 months

Proposed Reallocation:

Instead of the current payment schedule (details available
upon request), Sterling Co. is seeking a revised schedule
with consistent principal payments of approximately
$10,416.67 per month for the next 36 months. This would
provide greater financial flexibility and support ongoing
operational needs
