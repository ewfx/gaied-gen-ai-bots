When I reviewed my business account statement with the ending digits 7890, I found that some transactions were not what I was expecting. There were two outgoing vendor payments from October 25th which do not appear on my statement. I've checked our internal logs and payment records and they're definitely missing from what the bank is showing me. These specific payments were for vendor ID VEN-4567, totaling $2,350.00 and vendor ID VEN-9876, totaling $1,785.00 respectively.Could you please investigate this matter at your earliest convenience? A daily reconciliation is critical for our business, and these discrepancies are causing us some headaches.Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.Best regards,Julia RamirezAccounting ManagerAttached Documents:report_LN-107808.pdf
