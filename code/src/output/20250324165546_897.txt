Hi John,

See below. I've started gathering documentation from Peterson LLC. The initial details seem promising. I’ve requested the financial projections and ownership details. I'll forward everything to the back office once I have it all. I’m thinking this looks like a goer, but want to ensure everything checks out.

Thanks,
Sarah

Dear Mr. Davis,

Peterson LLC is exploring options for expanding our operations. We've been operating successfully for five years now, and our current projections point towards significant growth opportunities. We're interested in discussing a potential financial partnership with First National Commerce Bank to facilitate this expansion.

Could we schedule a meeting to discuss this further?

Sincerely,
Michael Peterson
