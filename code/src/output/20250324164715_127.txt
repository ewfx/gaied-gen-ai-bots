From: bernice.herrera@bankdomain.comDate: Tue, Oct 27, 2023 10:35 AMTo: finance.backoffice@bankdomain.comHi Team,Attached are the documents and email thread regarding Mr. Davies' request. It looks like he was charged a fee relating to a modification of his loan agreement. Could you please review and see if an exception can be made, given his long-standing relationship with the bank? The initial application was processed on July 15th, 2023. He flagged it on October 20th.Thanks,Bernice HerreraFront Office Associate-------- Original message --------From: william.davies@emailprovider.comDate: Tue, Oct 27, 2023 09:50 AMTo: bernice.herrera@bankdomain.comHi Bernice,Following up on our conversation from last week. As promised, I've attached a copy of my account statement showing the questionable charge of $350 which I believe is related to some paperwork needed on loan number 789012345. I've been a loyal customer for over 15 years and never had any issues before. It would be great if we could get this sorted out. Please see the attached statement. I also included a copy of the original loan agreement for your reference (attached).Thanks,William DaviesAttached Documents:report_LN-984535.docx
