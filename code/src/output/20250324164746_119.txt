Could you look into possibly shifting the funds differently to cover the costs?The transactions in question occurred on October 15th and 22nd, totaling $25,000 and $15,000, respectively (Transaction IDs: AX12345 and BY67890).I would appreciate it if you could provide an overview of the options available for a more cost-effective way to manage these allocations going forward.Thank you for your time and assistance.Best regards,Charles DavisonAttached Documents:report_LN-554094.pngreport_LN-640442.pdf
