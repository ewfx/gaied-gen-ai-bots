Specifically, I initiated a total of $5,000 in transfers over the past few weeks, in increments of $1,000 on April 10th, $2,000 on April 18th, and $2,000 on April 26th. However, my checking account statement reflects slightly less than the total requested amount.\n\nI'd greatly appreciate it if you could look into this for me. I suspect it has to do with fees, and I would want to know more. I have been with the bank for a long time and never had any issues. My account number is 123456789.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. I am including a copy of my ID.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMr. Robert Anderson\n\nAttached Documents:\nreport_LN-891267.docx\nreport_LN-347109.pdf\nreport_LN-793341.pdf"
