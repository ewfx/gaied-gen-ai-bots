Dear Ms. Rodriguez,

I am writing to request an urgent funds transfer from my business account (48792345) to a vendor. The details are as follows:

*   Beneficiary Name: Global Supply Chain Solutions Ltd.
*   Beneficiary Account: 987654321012
*   Beneficiary Bank: Continental Commerce Bank
*   SWIFT Code: CCBUSA33
*   Amount: $75,500.00
*   Reference: Invoice #GSCS-2023-10-102

This payment is extremely time-sensitive as it's the final installment payment due to Global Supply Chain Solutions Ltd for a critical shipment of components that we need to receive no later than Wednesday to maintain our production schedule. Any delay in the payment could disrupt our operations significantly. 

I have completed the transfer authorization form and attached it to this email. Please also find attached my recent account statement for your review.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
Li Chen
Li Chen Financials
