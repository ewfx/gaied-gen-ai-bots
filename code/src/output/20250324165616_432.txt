Thanks so much for grabbing this.  Could you please gather their latest financials (past 3 years should be sufficient) and also that contract they signed with GlobalTech Solutions?  Should be able to find it in their file, but let me know if you need any help.

Thanks!

Dear Charlotte,

Hope you're having a good week.

Following our conversation last week, I'm writing to formally request a review of our existing credit line (Account: 7894561230) in light of some recent fluctuations in the market and some significant operational changes at GlobalTech Solutions, our primary technology vendor. We're looking to proactively understand any potential impacts on our current financial standing.

Could you let me know what information you need from us to get the ball rolling?

Best regards,
Liam Walker
