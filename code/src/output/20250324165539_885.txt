Detailed Narrative Report
Portfolio Liquidation Analysis - Client: William Harrison - Account: 4567-8901-2345
Date: October 29, 2024
This report analyzes the potential impact of liquidating a portion of Mr. Harrison's portfolio to generate $75,000 in available funds. We have considered the following assets for potential sale:
Asset | Quantity | Current Price | Estimated Value | Potential Capital Gains
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
Stock ABC | 500 | $150 | $75,000 | $25,000
Bond XYZ | 100 | $1,050 | $105,000 | $5,000
Recommendation:
To meet the $75,000 target with minimal disruption, we recommend selling the entire Stock ABC holding. This will generate the required funds and minimize transaction costs associated with selling fractional units of Bond XYZ. Please note that the estimated capital gains figures are pre-tax and subject to change based on actual market conditions at the time of sale.
