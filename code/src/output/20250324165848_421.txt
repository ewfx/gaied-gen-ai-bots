Hi Finance Team,

Please find attached the documentation package for our new client, Mr. Alistair Finch. He's looking to establish a corporate account for his consulting firm, Finch & Associates.

We've collected all the required information, including his proof of address (utility bill dated September 15, 2023), articles of incorporation, and government-issued ID. We've also included the signed account application form, specifying an initial deposit of $75,000 from his personal account at Wells Fargo (Acct # ending in 5678). The anticipated monthly transaction volume is approximately $25,000 - $50,000.

Could you please proceed with the necessary verification steps and account setup? Let me know if you require any further information.

Best regards,
Brenda Jenkins
Commercial Banking Associate

Hi Brenda,

Thanks for sending over Alistair Finch's application. Just a quick clarification â€“ could you please confirm the exact date of incorporation for Finch & Associates? I couldn't find it explicitly stated in the initial documents, and I need that to finalise the internal record (Attached is the supporting document).

Also, did you happen to get a copy of a recent bank statement from Wells Fargo to verify the account mentioned for the initial deposit? It would help speed things up on their end.

Thanks so much!
Amelia
Front Office Assistant
