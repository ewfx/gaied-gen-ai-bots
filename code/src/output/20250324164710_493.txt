Sarah at Johnson Corp is asking for some clarification around charges related to a few transfers from last month. All the supporting documentation from Sarah is below and I also pulled their account history so you have that too. Iâ€™ve flagged the relevant transactions in the account summary. Let me know if you need anything else from me.Thanks,Brenda MillerCommercial Banking OfficerContinental Bank-------- Original message --------From: Sarah.Jenkins@johnsoncorp.comDate: Tuesday, October 24, 2023 2:58 PMTo: Brenda.Miller@continentalbank.comSubject: Account Adjustment Request - Johnson CorpHi Brenda,Hope you're having a good week. Following up on our conversation last week. I'm still a bit confused about some of the service fees associated with a couple of wire transfers we made on September 15th and September 18th (Transaction ID: WT20230915-448 and WT20230918-912). They seem a bit higher than usual. I believe these related to internal re-classifications that should have been cost neutral.Could you please look into this for me? I've attached a summary report detailing the internal accounting codes impacted, please see "Johnson Corp Internal Reclassification Report.pdf"Thanks so much for your help!Best,Sarah JenkinsAccounting ManagerJohnson CorpAttached Documents:report_LN-616284.png

Reclassification Impact Analysis
Date: October 24, 2023

This report outlines the intemal reclassification of funds
within Johnson Corp and its impact on associated service
fees. It specifically addresses the wire transfers executed
on September 15th and September 18th, 2023.

Transaction Details:

Transaction ID: WT20230915-448
Date: September 15, 2023

Amount: $75,000.00

Account Debited: 12345-67890 (Operating Account)

Transaction ID: WT20230918-912

Amount: $42,000.00

Account Debited: 12345-67890 (Operating Account)
Account Credited: 54321-09876 (Marketing Budget Account)

Fee Discrepancy:
The attached fee statements from Continental Bank indicate a
service charge of $35.00 per transaction. However, given the
nature of these transfers as intemal reclassifications, we
believe a lower fee structure or a waiver may be applicable.
Our understanding is that such internal movements should be
considered differently than extemal wire transfers to

vendors or other entities.
