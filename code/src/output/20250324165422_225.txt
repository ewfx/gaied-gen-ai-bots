Dear Grandview Commercial Bank Team,I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request assistance in understanding some transactions on my company's account. I've noticed some discrepancies in the recent statements, particularly regarding withdrawals made during the summer months, which don't quite align with our internal records.My account number is 7890-1234-5678, and I am particularly concerned about the period from July 1, 2023, to September 30, 2023. I believe there were a few large withdrawals that require further examination. For instance, I recall a significant wire transfer in mid-August to a company I'm not entirely familiar with. I would appreciate it if you could provide a detailed transaction log for the specified period, highlighting any withdrawals exceeding $10,000. I believe this will help us reconcile our records and ensure everything is in order.Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. Please let me know if you require any additional information from my end.Sincerely,Evelyn AlbrightAlbright Enterprises
