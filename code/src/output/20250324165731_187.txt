Hi Eleanor,

Following up on our conversation this morning. As discussed, our account, 7894561230, has seen increased activity recently, and we want to ensure that any shortfalls are handled smoothly to avoid disruptions.

Please find attached report 1, detailing our projected cash flow for the next quarter. This outlines our expected revenue and expenditures. I've also attached report 2, which outlines our account activity for the last year; you can use this to understand our regular business cycle.

I appreciate your help with this. We really need to make sure that everything is working seamlessly to avoid delays.

Thanks,
Daniel Holloway
Acme Corp.
