Following our call earlier today, I'm sending over the documents we discussed.  As you know, we have a recurring debit arrangement with Global Solutions Inc. for their services. I need to make sure this is running without a hitch and that the correct amounts are being debited on time.
Attached you will find the authorization form signed by myself, a copy of our agreement with Global Solutions, and the relevant bank statement section.  Please let me know if any further information is needed.
Thanks for your help,
