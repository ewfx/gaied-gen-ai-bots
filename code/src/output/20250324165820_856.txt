Dear Amelia,
Following our conversation on Wednesday, I'm formally requesting an adjustment to my business credit line. The current approved limit of $250,000 is higher than our current operational needs. Given the forecasted revenue and expenditure for Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, the revised amount will assist in improving the overall financial efficiency.
My account number is 7894561230 and the business is registered under Davies Innovations LLC. Please let me know what information you require from me to proceed.
Sincerely,
Eleanor Davies

Davies Innovations LLC
Credit Line Adjustment Rationale
Date: October 27, 2023
To Whom It May Concern:
This letter serves to provide the rationale for the requested adjustment to our business credit line with Continental Trust Bank. After careful analysis of our projected cash flow and operational needs for the upcoming fiscal year, we've determined that our current approved limit of $250,000 is higher than necessary. We have experienced a decrease in the raw material prices with vendor Titan Corporation (Transaction ID: TXN-2023-10-26-ABC). Furthermore, improved internal efficiency has reduced our reliance on short-term financing. Therefore, we request the value be revised to be $100,000.
Sincerely,
Eleanor Davies
CEO, Davies Innovations LLC
