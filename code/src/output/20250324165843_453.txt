Hi Team,




Could you please review the attached documents for Sterling Innovations? The client submitted an application for a business account and we've gathered all the required verification materials. Please see attached report 1 which gives a full reconciliation of the vendors they have been working with for the last year. Attached report 2 details some of the financial statements, but feel free to reach out to me if you need any additional information from the client. 


Thanks so much for your assistance with this.


Best regards,


Amelia Chen

Hi Samuel,




Thank you for your patience. Further to our conversation yesterday about opening a business account for Sterling Innovations. Before we proceed with formally opening the account we require some supporting documentation for verification. For our verification process we would require you to provide:


- Proof of ID with photograph (drivers license, passport)

- Articles of Incorporation

- A list of vendors that Sterling Innovations has worked with for the last year. This can be a simple excel document with the business name and a short description of their service.

- The company financial statements for the past year.



Please send the required documents over and I will review them and submit the final account opening request to our back office team.



Best regards,
