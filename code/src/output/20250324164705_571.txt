Thanks,Esther LeeFront OfficeFrom: sarah.thompson@customerdomain.comSent: Friday, October 27, 2023 11:15 AMTo: esther.lee@bankdomain.comSubject: Inquiry regarding incorrect fees charged to account 9876-5432-1010Dear Esther,Following our conversation earlier this week, I'm sending over the documents you requested. As I mentioned, I've noticed some unusual charges appearing on my business account, 9876-5432-1010. Specifically, the transactions dated October 12th and October 19th, both for $75 each, labelled as "Service Fee" seem incorrect. I wasn't informed about these fees beforehand, and they weren't applied to my account previously. I've attached a statement highlighting these transactions (please see attached statement.pdf).Could you please investigate this issue and have these fees reversed or clarified? I'm also attaching a copy of my original account agreement (please see attached agreement.pdf) for your reference. There's also another attachment as well (attached report.pdf) that details all of the transactions of last month. Thank you for your help with this matter.Sincerely,Sarah ThompsonAttached Documents:report_LN-952165.pdfreport_LN-391233.docxreport_LN-602340.pdf
