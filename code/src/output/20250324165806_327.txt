My business, Vance Industries, has experienced significant growth over the past few months, and I believe an adjustment would be beneficial. My account number is 7894561230. I can provide any necessary documentation to support my request. Let me know what information you need. We've had a few large invoices lately. For example, invoice INV-2024-10-28-001 from Stellar Supplies for $75,000, and INV-2024-10-27-002 from Galactic Goods for $92,000 (both dated last week). These are typical of the higher volume we're currently experiencing. I appreciate your assistance with this matter.Best regards,Elara VanceVance IndustriesAttached Documents:report_LN-621899.docxreport_LN-308278.docx
