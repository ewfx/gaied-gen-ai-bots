Hi Credit Team,
Forwarding the request from Martin Holdings. We've collected their updated financials, including income statements for the last two quarters and the revised projections for Q4 2023 and Q1 2024. I've also included the collateral appraisal report we commissioned from Anderson Appraisals last week. They're looking for an increase to their operational flexibility. Please let me know if you need any further documentation. Attached you will find all of them.
Thanks,

Dear Stephanie,
This email is to formally request a review of our current financial arrangement. We've experienced significant growth in Q3 and foresee this trend continuing into the next year. We are attaching documentation outlining our recent financial performance and projections.
We've also included a list of recent invoices from our key suppliers, including Sterling Supplies (Invoice #SS-20231026-1) for $75,000, and Davidson Logistics (Invoice #DL-20231025-4) for $42,000. Our account number is 12345-67890. We believe this adjustment would greatly benefit our operational capabilities and allow us to capitalize on these growth opportunities.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Robert Martin
CEO, Martin Holdings LLC
