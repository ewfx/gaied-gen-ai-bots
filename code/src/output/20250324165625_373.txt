Eleanor,

Thanks for your help. I've filled out the questionnaire as requested and attached it. Iâ€™ve also included a copy of my recent trade confirmations for reference. Please let me know what the next steps are. I am particularly interested in understanding the possible fluctuation in my portfolio due to factors affecting global markets and the impact of current events on specific assets within my holdings.

Best,

Robert Davis
