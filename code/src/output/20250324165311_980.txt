Due to some unexpected market shifts, our projected cash flow for the next year has been slightly impacted. I have attached a detailed cash flow forecast. As you know, we secured the initial loan of $500,000 on July 15, 2022, with an interest rate of 6.75%. The loan was structured for a 5 year repayment period.Would it be possible to re-evaluate the repayment terms? I have attached the updated financial projections for the next 18 months. Please let me know what documentation is required to formally submit this request.Thank you for your assistance.Sincerely,Robert DudleyCFO, Gillingham EnterprisesAttached Documents:report_LN-559166.pdfreport_LN-924934.pngreport_LN-469332.pdf
