Over the past few months, my financial needs have shifted somewhat, and I need to access a significant portion of the funds within the next few weeks, ideally by November 15th. I'd like to evaluate the possibility of restructuring my holdings to achieve this while minimizing potential losses. Please could you provide a breakdown of my current holdings and any recommendations you might have to achieve these goals? I had an unexpected medical expense and need the money quite fast. Please provide me with the required documents for this process, and let me know if you need any further information from my side.
