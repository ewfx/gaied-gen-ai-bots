Subject: Collateral Review - Johnson & Sons, Inc.
Client: Johnson & Sons, Inc.
Account Number: 9876-5432-1011
Request Date: October 26, 2023
Property Address: 123 Industrial Drive, Anytown, USA
Summary:
This document provides a reconciliation of the current market conditions affecting the
value of the collateral property. The client has expressed an interest in expanding their
facilities and requires an updated property valuation.
Key Considerations:
Recent comparable sales in the area indicate a moderate increase in commercial property
values since the last valuation in 2020. The attached appraisal report (Ref# APR2023-789)
provides a detailed analysis of these market trends.
The updated financial statements reflect the company's continued strong performance,
supporting their ability to service the existing loan and potential additional debt.
The property tax assessment confirms the current assessed value of the land and
improvements.
Recommendation:
Review the attached documents in detail to determine if any action is required.
