To Whom It May Concern,
I am writing regarding a potential issue with a recent series of transfers from my investment holdings account to my checking account (ending in 7890). Specifically, I initiated a total of $5,000 in transfers over the past few weeks, in increments of $1,000 on April 10th, $2,000 on April 18th, and $2,000 on April 26th. However, my checking account statement reflects slightly less than the total requested amount.
I'd greatly appreciate it if you could look into this for me. I suspect it has to do with fees, and I would want to know more. I have been with the bank for a long time and never had any issues. My account number is 123456789.
Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I am including a copy of my ID.
Sincerely,
Mr. Robert Anderson
