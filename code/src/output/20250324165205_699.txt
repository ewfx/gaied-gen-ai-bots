Hi Michael,

Following up on my request from yesterday regarding verifying some account information. I need confirmation that my current address and phone number on file with you are correct. My account number is 7894561230. I'm trying to finalize some paperwork for a loan application with Crestline Financial, and they require this information directly from my bank.

Thanks for your help!

Eleanor Vance
