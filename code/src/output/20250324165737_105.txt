Subject: Urgent - Account Review Request - Peterson Corp.

Dear John,I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to request an urgent review of our account (ending in -8922) due to anticipated fluctuating cash flow in the upcoming weeks. We have a large vendor payment of $75,000.00 scheduled for October 27th (Invoice #INV-2023-10-003 from Davidson Supplies) that may put us close to, or temporarily below, our usual operating balance.We are expecting a large incoming payment of $120,000.00 around November 5th from a client project (Transaction ID: PX98765). However, until then, we're looking for a way to ensure that all transactions continue to be processed smoothly without any interruptions.Could you please advise on the best course of action? We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.Best regards,Rhonda BarnabyPeterson Corp.
