Acme Corp Financial Projections

This document outlines Acme Corp's revised financial
forecasts for the upcoming fiscal year. As you can see, we

are projecting a reduction in operating expenses due to
increased efficiency and streamlined processes. The decrease

in projected expenditure is substantial and permanent, hence
the adjustment to the facility is required. Specifically, we
forecast a 15% decrease in borrowing requirements across all
sectors of the business.
Attached Report 2: Vendor Contract Analysis
This report details the renegotiated contracts with our key vendors, including Delta
Supply Chain, for the period of 2024-2026. These contracts reflect significantly reduced
pricing due to bulk purchasing agreements and improved payment terms. Vendor A agreement
number is VDA-3948, Vendor B agreement number is VDB-2837. We have successfully lowered
our overall cost base, resulting in lower capital needs for the forthcoming year.
