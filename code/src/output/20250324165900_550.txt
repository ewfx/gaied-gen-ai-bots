Lakeside Innovations - Initial Due Diligence Summary

Date: October 27, 2024
Prepared By: Maria Garcia
Client: Lakeside Innovations Inc.

Background
Lakeside Innovations Inc. is seeking to establish a
commercial banking relationship with Valley Bank. The
company is a technology startup specializing in Al-powered
data analytics solutions for the healthcare industry. They
project significant revenue growth within the next 12-18
months based on signed contracts with several major hospital
networks. Their projected annual revenue is estimated to
reach $5,000,000 within the first year.

Key Contacts:
David Miller — CEO (david.miller@lakesideinnovations.com,
555-123-4567)
Sarah Chen — CFO (sarah.chen@lakesideinnovations.com,
555-987-6543)

Summary of Conversation with CEO:
Mr. Miller expressed a need for a comprehensive suite of
banking services, including: commercial checking account,
business credit card, and a $500,000 line of credit to
support operational expenses during their expansion phase
He provided information regarding their major upcoming
project involving development of a predictive analytics
platform for early disease detection, estimated to generate
revenue of $2,000,000 by Q2 2025.

Risk Assessment
Preliminary assessment indicates a moderate level of risk,
given the company's startup status. However, their strong
growth projections and established contracts mitigate this
risk. Further due diligence is recommended, including
verification of the signed contracts and a deeper dive into
their financial projections. An initial credit check on Mr.
Miller and Ms. Chen is also advised
