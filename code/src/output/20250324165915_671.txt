Hi Back Office Team,

Could you please take a look at this inquiry from Mr. Thompson? He's seeking some direction with his accounts and has provided the documents he mentioned. I've attached the profile questionnaire and copies of his statements. Please let me know if you need anything else from my end.

Thanks!

Subject: Inquiry Regarding Portfolio Options


Dear Ms. Jenkins,

Following our conversation last week on the phone, I'm writing to formalize my request for some assistance with managing my portfolio. As discussed, I'm approaching retirement soon (December 15th, to be exact!) and I would like to adjust my investment strategy with a tilt towards less risk. I'd appreciate your expert insights on how to best allocate my assets to secure a comfortable retirement income.

I've attached a completed profile questionnaire detailing my financial goals and risk tolerance, along with copies of my recent investment statements from Bank ABC (accounts ending in 4567 and 9876) for your review. Additionally, I have a brokerage account at Goldman Sachs (account # GS78901) where I hold some tech stocks. I can provide those statements as well, if necessary.

My primary goal is to generate an annual income of approximately $75,000 in retirement. I am open to discussing different options for how to achieve that, balancing returns with capital preservation. I am available to meet at your earliest convenience to discuss the next steps.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. Looking forward to your reply!

Sincerely,

Harold Thompson
