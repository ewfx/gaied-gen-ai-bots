I hope this clarifies the situation with the recent accruals on account ending in 7890. I have attached copies of the relevant statements from Q3 of this year, along with a letter explaining the discrepancy I believe exists. The total I'm expecting to see reflected in the accrual calculations, based on my understanding, is $1,750.25, not the $1,687.50 that is currently shown.Please see attached report 1 (statement 1) and attached report 2 (statement 2).I appreciate your assistance in resolving this.Sincerely,John Davis
