Dear Bethany,
                      
Thank you for your time this afternoon. As discussed, we are planning a significant expansion of our operations and would like to explore our options for financing with Front Office Bank. We're projecting needing around $750,000 to cover initial equipment purchases and renovations to our new warehouse location at 123 Industrial Drive. Our current account number is 9876543210.
                      
Could you please advise on the next steps and the documents required from our end? We are aiming to have this expansion finalized by Q1 of next year.
                      
Thank you for your assistance.
                      
Sincerely,
                      Jasper Finch
                      CEO, Acme Corp

Acme Corporation - Financial Statement Reconciliation
For the period ending September 30, 2024, a reconciliation of Acme Corporation's
internally generated financial statements has been conducted. The purpose is to ensure
accuracy and provide additional support for our expansion request. Key findings are
summarized below:
1.  Revenue Confirmation: Total revenues reported on the unaudited income statement for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were $2,500,000. This was compared against
actual sales invoices (sample size of 100 invoices, representing 10% of total sales
transactions). Discrepancies were identified on 3 invoices, totaling $450. Correcting
journal entries have been made to reflect this adjustment.
2.  Inventory Valuation: Inventory as of September 30, 2024, was stated at $350,000 using
the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method. A physical inventory count was conducted on October
15, 2024. Differences were noted amounting to a write-down of $15,000 due to obsolescence.
3.  Accounts Receivable: The accounts receivable balance as of September 30, 2024, was
$425,000. An aging analysis was performed. $25,000 was over 90 days past due. We have made
adjustments as management has assessed that they are not recoverable and are written off.
4. Fixed Assets: An independent appraisal was undertaken to ascertain the open market
value of our business warehouse.
The report indicates that it is currently valued at $1,000,000.
These adjustments have been incorporated into the attached financial projection documents.
