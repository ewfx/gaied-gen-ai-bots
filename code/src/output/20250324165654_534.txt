After reviewing everything, specifically the transaction history for July and August, and considering the scale of activity with Golden Gate Consulting, we've identified a few discrepancies that warrant further investigation. The attached analysis highlights the areas of concern.Specifically, the average transaction value seems significantly higher than what's typical for this type of service agreement. Please double-check the contracted rates and deliverables with Golden Gate Consulting. Also, the payment frequency appears inconsistent; there were three payments in July alone, which deviates from the standard monthly schedule outlined in the initial contract (report 1). Additionally, verify that all invoices were properly authorized before processing.Could you reach out to the client to confirm the details and gather additional context? This will help us ensure that all processes are aligned and functioning optimally. Report 2 provides the specific transactions that need clarification.Best,David ChenBack Office OperationsFirst National Bank

Detailed Narrative Report
Analysis of Irregularities
Account Number: 1234567890
Client: Miller Enterprises
Vendor: Golden Gate Consulting
Observed Discrepancies:
1. Excessive Transactions in July 2023: The standard billing frequency is monthly. However, in July 2023, there were three separate transactions (TXN-20230705-003, TXN-20230718-004, TXN-20230728-005). This deviates from the established payment schedule and requires justification.
2. Elevated Average Transaction Value: While the contract revisions explain the increase in monthly rates, the average transaction value appears higher than expected. Further investigation is needed to ensure that all invoices are accurately reflecting the services rendered and align with the contractual agreement.
