Hi Team,
Please find attached all the documents we've gathered from Mr. Davies. He's looking to move his business banking over to us. It looks like a promising opportunity, given their recent growth. Attached report 1 includes all his corporate filings, while attached report 2 contains the personal identification documents. I've also attached the completed application form as requested, in attached report 3.
Could you please expedite this? He's keen to get the account up and running by next week so he can start processing payments through our system.
Thanks,Elena VolkovRelationship ManagerBank Alpha

Hi Elena,
Just checking in on the Davies Corp onboarding. Have you gathered all the necessary documentation yet? We need everything submitted by EOD today if they want that account active by next week. Remember the new checklist requirements for KYC. I know it is a lot but the compliance team is really tightening the screws on us.
Thanks,Liam MurphyFront Office ManagerBank Alpha

Hi Liam,
As requested, I'm sending over all the information regarding Davies Corp. I've included the required documentation. I am hoping to have this sorted asap, as you promised it would all be sorted by next week. I have already told my current provider I would be leaving as you stated you can easily transfer everything. I am hoping for a speedy response. The date to have everything done by is the 3rd of November 2023.
Regards,
Robert Davies
