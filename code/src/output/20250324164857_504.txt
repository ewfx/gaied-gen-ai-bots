Eliza,Per our conversation, I've compiled all the documentation received from Julia at AlphaTech.  AlphaTech is seeking to amend the scheduled payments to vendors, specifically regarding the new platform rollout. Please find attached the vendor payment schedule proposal (attached report 1) and their latest financial statement (attached report 2). Julia has also authorized us to adjust the upcoming payment of $75,000 scheduled for vendor 'TechForward Solutions' on November 15th, account number ending 8921, if needed. Please forward to the back office for their review and action. I will be out of office from the 1st of November for two weeks. I will be available at my number 415-555-1212.

Hi Ben,Following our discussion last week, we would like to request an adjustment to our vendor payment schedule. We are in the process of implementing the new software across all departments and expect significant operational efficiencies. This change requires a short-term adjustment to some of our scheduled payments. I hope you are doing well, and I have attached all documents as requested.
