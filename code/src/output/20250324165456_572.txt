This report provides a reconciliation of Mr. Clarence Harrison's bond holdings as of
October 27, 2023, based on information received from both Mr. Harrison and Example Bank's
internal records. Account Number: CH7892345. The total value of bonds purchased is
$500,000.00. The following discrepancies were identified:
1.  Initial Investment Date: Mr. Harrison's records indicate a purchase date of June 15,
2020, while Example Bank's records show a purchase date of June 16, 2020. This discrepancy
is due to time zone differences. Resolved.
2.  Vendor Payment: Mr. Harrison provided a receipt from Sterling Investments for
$250,000.00 on July 22, 2021, which we have located in our ledger with transaction ID
TXN-987654. Second payment was from Morgan Stanley and we've confirmed with ID TXN-123456,
date Aug 10 2021. Total from Sterling Investments: $250,000.00, and from Morgan Stanley:
$250,000.00
3.  Interest Payments: Example Bank records show interest payments totaling $30,000.00
over the past three years (2020-2023) at a rate of 2% annually with a total tax
implication of 7%. Mr. Harrison's records indicate a discrepancy of $1000. After careful
review of tax and accounting adjustments, we believe Mr. Harrison's records do not account
for certain fees.
Conclusion: After review, the differences in calculations are due to bank processing fees
and timezone differences. All balances and amounts match bank records.
