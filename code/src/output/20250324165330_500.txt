Amelia,I've compiled all the documents and information Zenith Dynamics provided. This includes their most recent financial statements (attached report 3), updated revenue projections, and the signed agreement form. I spoke with Michael at Zenith, and he confirmed they are expecting a slower growth rate in Q1 2025, which is why they are requesting a change to the payments.Let me know if you need anything else.Thanks,John SmithFront Office Bank
