Hi Team,

Please find attached the documents related to the international trade facilitation request from Global Dynamics Inc. (Account: 892-555-0122). I have attached their initial request and a summary of their previous transactions as requested by Ms. Davenport.

Could you please initiate the necessary internal procedure? Please let me know if anything else is required from my end.

Thanks!

Dear Amelia,Thank you for forwarding this request. I've reviewed the documentation you've provided for Global Dynamics Inc. and have a couple of questions before proceeding.Firstly, could you confirm the beneficiary details for transaction ID TXN-20241028-GDInc? I need to verify the receiving party's bank and account information. Also, it would be helpful to have a more detailed breakdown of the fees associated with the transaction request. Please see attached draft letter.Regards,Daniel ChenTrade Finance DepartmentFirst Mercantile BankAttached Documents:report_LN-942073.pdf
