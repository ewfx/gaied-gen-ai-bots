Hi David,

Hope you’re having a good morning.

Following our conversation last week, please find attached Mr. Thompson’s recent financial summary and investment preference document. I believe this captures the scope of advisory he is seeking. I would appreciate it if you could review the attached documents when you have a chance and provide me with the best path forward in terms of his holdings across different product segments.

Let me know if you require any additional data.

Best,
Eleanor
