Dear Ms. Chen,Following our discussion last week regarding the company’s current financial situation, I am formally requesting an adjustment to our existing credit facility. Specifically, we are looking to modify the total approved amount. As discussed, we have experienced a contraction in our operational needs due to a shift in market demands.I have attached all the requested materials, including updated financials, revised business plan, and the personal guarantee as you requested. Please see attached report 1, report 2, and report 3.Please let me know if any further information is needed from my end.Sincerely,David HarrisonCEO, Example CompanyAttached Documents:report_LN-562568.png

## Example Conjpany Financial Reconciliation - Credit

Facility Reduction

*Account** Commercial Lending Facility
“Account Number:** 9876543210

“Transaction ID:** AMD-20231024-001

*Vendor:* Example Company

“Original Approved Amount** $2,500,000.00
“Requested New Approved Amount** $1,800,000.00

**Reason for Reduction:**

Following a strategic review of operational needs and
projected revenue streams, Example Company has determined
that the current approved credit facility amount exceeds its,
anticipated requirements for the foreseeable future. The
company has successfully optimized its supply chain and
streamlined its operational processes, resulting in a

reduced demand for working capital. The updated financial
projections, included in the attached documentation, reflect
this reduced reliance on extemal financing

**Impact on Financial Statements:**

The reduction in the credit facility will result in the
following key changes to Example Company's financial
statements:

* ™Balance Sheet A decrease in the amount of
outstanding debt will improve the company's debt-to-equity
ratio and overall financial leverage

* *Income Statement** Reduced interest expense
associated with the lower credit facility balance will
positively impact the company's net income.

* Cash Flow Statement* The amendment will not
materially impact the company's cash flow statement, as the
reduction is not related to core operational activities.

“Mitigation Strategies:*

Example Company has implemented a series of risk mitigation
strategies to ensure that the reduced credit facility amount
remains sufficient to meet its operational needs. These
strategies include:

* Enhanced inventory management practices
* Negotiated extended payment terms with key suppliers
* Diversification of revenue streams through expansion
into new markets

*Supporting Documentation:**
* Updated Financial Projections for FY2024-2025

* Revised Business Plan
* Personal Guarantee of CEO
